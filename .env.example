# Frontend Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env.local and update with your actual values

# Backend API URL (EC2 instance running the backend service)
# This should point to your EC2 instance IP and port
# Format: http://EC2_IP:PORT or https://your-domain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://YOUR_EC2_IP:8001

# Requestor API URL (if different from main API)
# For now, this points to the same backend
NEXT_PUBLIC_REQUESTOR_URL=http://YOUR_EC2_IP:8001

# Example for production:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
# NEXT_PUBLIC_REQUESTOR_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com

# Important Notes:
# 1. Variables MUST use the NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix to be accessible in the browser
# 2. These values are embedded at BUILD time, not runtime
# 3. You MUST rebuild the application (npm run build) when changing these values
# 4. Never commit .env.local to version control
# 5. For S3 deployment, rebuild and redeploy after changing these values
