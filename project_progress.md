## Implementation Complete: Application Status Indicator
I've successfully implemented the visual status indicator feature for the application list. Here's what was done:

### Changes Made:
1. Updated Type Definitions (types/index.ts)
Added api_keys?: APIKeyInfo[] field to the Application interface
Added is_active?: boolean field to track active status
2. Added API Service Function (services/api.ts)
Created getApplicationApiKeys() function to fetch API keys for each application
Returns an array of APIKeyInfo objects containing the is_active status
Gracefully handles errors by returning an empty array
3. Enhanced ApplicationList Component (components/ApplicationList.tsx)
Added State Management: Uses useState to track application statuses
Added useEffect Hook: Fetches API keys for all applications on component mount
Active Status Logic: An application is considered "active" if it has at least one API key with is_active: true
Visual Status Badge: Created getStatusBadge() function that displays:
ðŸŸ¢ Green badge with "Active" text for applications with active API keys
âšª Grey badge with "Inactive" text for applications without active API keys
âšª Grey badge with "Loading..." and pulsing animation while fetching data
UI Integration: Badge appears next to the application name in the card header
Visual Design:

### ApplicationList.tsx
YANTECH-YNP01-GitHub-Priv-Repo-FrontEnd/components
How It Works:
On Dashboard Load: When the ApplicationList component mounts, it fetches API keys for all applications
Status Determination: For each application, it checks if any API key has is_active: true
Visual Feedback: Displays a color-coded badge next to each application name
Auto-Update: When onUpdate() is called (after creating/deleting apps), the status indicators refresh automatically
Features:
âœ… Real-time Status: Fetches actual API key data from the backend
âœ… Visual Clarity: Green for active, grey for inactive
âœ… Loading State: Shows loading indicator while fetching data
âœ… Error Handling: Gracefully handles API failures
âœ… Responsive Design: Works on all screen sizes
âœ… Auto-refresh: Updates when applications list changes
